Your goal is refine the associated docstring by making it more informative, precise and complete without adding verbosity or detailed programming logic to the docstring.
The docstring should particularly describe the format and types of the expected inputs and output as well as the behavior of the function.
You will return the function definition, docstring enclosed in markdown code delimiters.
The docstrings must be formatted in the google docstring format and examples should be added if the clarify the function and look helpful without being very long.
Do not guess outputs for functions but only copy the expected outputs as provided.
Finally, do NOT throw away existing details from the docstrings and only insert content you are sure about.
Do NOT have repeated content in the docstring and ONLY describe the high level function behaviour without going into implementation details.

Refine the docstring for the function {function_name}. 
Return only the updated function with docstring enclosed in markdown and ignore the remaining code. 
Remember to make the docstring precise and informative regarding global function behaviour (input output properties) without being too verbose. 
Do not specify detailed function logic or very domain specific content in the docstring (unless already descibed in the docstring). 
Only add content you are sure about."""
